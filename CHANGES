List of user visible changes between 0.4.3 and 0.5.0

	Added external include path settings file for erlang projects
	(just like external modules file)

	fixed bug when build backend was called "erlide"

	Indentation uses tabs, indents only affected functions, and is
		cleaned up a bit
	fixes around backend startup and ide backend
    Fixed autocompletion so that external modules can be completed
 
    Fixed a slight oversight when accessing external files (it should be
	created and have the erlang nature)
	Added error marker if a file could not be compiled at all
		(compiler crashed or no backend)
    Auto-completion didn't work when both default_external_modules and
	external_modules were specified (open did the right thing).

	214: updated jinterface to R12
	optimized RPC performance by caching call signatures
	New, fancier, better, smarter reconciler!
	  - Scans all changes after one delay
	  - Parses after all changes, not for each one of them (no more
	  shuffling after undo or find/replace)
	  - Method to reconcile without delay and wait for it, so model is
	  up-to-date, e.g. for model commands like Completion or Open
	Small improvement of dirty region handling, works better with
	  backspace
	Autoindent now also uses tabs
	Honour the Preferences -> General / Editors / Text Editors /
	  Insert spaces for tabs checkbox, when indenting, if it's checked,
	  use only spaces.
	Restored reset handling in reconciler, so it doesn't reconcile
	  during lengthy typing, but afterwards
	added runtimeVersion project preference, to allow not specifying
	  a runtime name (that are user specific)
